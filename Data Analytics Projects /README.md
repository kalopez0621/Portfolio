## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a CSV file provided with the following columns:
- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each order.
- **Order Date**: Date when the order was placed.
- **Product Category**: Categories like Electronics, Furniture, Clothing, etc.
- **Sales**: Revenue generated by the sale.
- **Profit**: Profit made from the sale.
- **Quantity Sold**: Number of items sold.
- **Region**: Regions like North, South, East, West.
- **Customer Segment**: Types of customers (e.g., Regular, Premium).

The dataset was loaded into Tableau and underwent basic cleaning to ensure consistency and usability.

## Tasks and Approach

### Data Connection and Cleaning
1. **Data Import**: Connected Tableau to the provided CSV dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handled inconsistencies in region names and addressed missing data to ensure accurate analysis.

### Dashboard Creation

#### Sales Analysis
- **Total Sales by Product Category**: Created a bar chart to showcase the sales for each product category.
- **Sales Trends Over Time**: Used a line chart to display monthly/quarterly sales trends, highlighting seasonal patterns.

#### Profit Analysis
- **Sales vs. Profit Comparison**: Developed a scatter plot to illustrate the relationship between sales and profit across product categories.

#### Regional Performance
- **Sales by Region**: Created a map visualization to highlight sales distribution and identify high and low-performing regions.

#### Customer Segmentation
- **Sales by Customer Segment**: Used a pie chart to show the proportion of sales contributed by different customer segments (e.g., Regular, Premium).

### Interactivity
1. **Filters**: Added filters for region, product category, and customer segment to allow users to explore specific aspects of the data.
2. **Linked Actions**: Enabled actions so that clicking on a specific region on the map updates the sales analysis for that region, enhancing the user’s interactive experience.

## Key Insights and Recommendations

- **Most Profitable Product Category**: [Provide brief insight, e.g., "Electronics shows the highest profitability."]
- **Improvement Opportunity**: [Mention region or category needing improvement, e.g., "South region shows lower sales compared to other regions."]

### Recommendations:
1. **Focus on high-performing categories** by allocating more resources to increase inventory or marketing.
2. **Enhance marketing efforts** in underperforming regions to drive growth in those areas.

## Results

The Tableau dashboard is fully interactive, enabling users to filter data by various dimensions and discover insights. Users can view performance metrics across categories, regions, and customer segments, providing a holistic view of the company’s sales performance.

## Files Included
- **Retail_Sales_Dashboard.twbx**: Tableau workbook with the interactive dashboard.
- **Sales_Performance_Data.csv**: CSV file containing the sales data.
- **README.md**: Project overview and instructions.
