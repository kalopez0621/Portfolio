"""---------------------------------------------------
Assignment is to code a utility that aids in unit conversion. The software should individually prompt user to input four 
separate lengths, each specified in inches. Following this, the program should convert these lengths and present the results
in a table, showing their equivalents in yards, feet, and centimeters. The table should be formatted into four columns, and 
the values for yards, feet and centimeters should be rounded to two decimal places.
